# Code Cleanup Report - nind-denoise

**Date:** 2025-09-19  
**Analysis Period:** Recent commits and current codebase state

## Summary

Conducted comprehensive code review and cleanup of the nind-denoise repository to remove deprecated code, fix structural
issues, and streamline the codebase.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix test imports** - Resolve RL test relative import issues
2. **Remove deployment scrips** which are no longer necessary.
3. Broader review of neural network and tool modules for active use
4. **Review dataset tools** - Many training/dataset tools may not be needed for production use
5. **Review neural network modules** in `src/nind_denoise/networks/` - Many appear unused by current pipeline
6. **Review tool scripts** in `src/nind_denoise/tools/` - Many may be development utilities not needed for main
   functionality
7. **Consolidate utilities** - Multiple utility libraries with potential overlap

## Current Active Components (Confirmed in Use)

- `src/denoise.py` - Main CLI entry point
- `src/nind_denoise/pipeline.py` - Core pipeline logic
- `src/nind_denoise/rl_pt/` - Richardson-Lucy deconvolution (PyTorch implementation)
- `src/config/` - Configuration files
- `tests/test_denoise_cli.py` - Working CLI test
- [incomplete - add more as they are found]

## Git History Analysis

Recent commits show:

- Addition of RL PyTorch implementation (active)
- Previous removal of test files (362764f, e51b5c5)
- Enhanced RL test cases that were later moved
- Rollback of some AI changes (491c5e2)
