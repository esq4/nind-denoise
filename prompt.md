A major refactor was recently completed. Backwards compatibility was intentionally not retained, and as a result many of
the errors relate to

Some test are failing - can you please:

	- run the tests in tests\
	- identify the root causes of the errors causing the tests to fail 
		- perform any additional information gathering you need
	- present to me a venn diagram of problems and the tests they affect
	- write up a implementation plan for solutions to address the failing tests
 	- Do not consider any solution that implements any sort of backwards compatibility interface, stub, or any other type of fix that address on the test failing and not the underlying problem in the code. These are not solutions.
	- Save your plan to a .md file and ask for comfirmation to proceed with your plan
